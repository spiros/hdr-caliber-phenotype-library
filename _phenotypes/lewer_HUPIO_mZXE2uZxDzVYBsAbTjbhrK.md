### Primary care

{% include csv.html csvdata=site.data.codelists.lewer_HUPIO_mZXE2uZxDzVYBsAbTjbhrK_SNOMEDCT %}

### Implementation

We selected patients by identifying product codes indicating a prescription of OAT and clinical codes indicating a history of illicit opioid use, such as ‘heroin dependence’ (see extended data for a full code list23). We prioritised specificity over sensitivity, aiming to use codes that are only applied to the target population.

We used keywords to search CPRD dictionaries to find Read and SNOMED clinical codes that may illicit opioid use (methadone; buprenorphine; abus*; addict;  ependen*; drug user; heroin; inject; misus*; opiate; opioid; overdose). Our search identified 1,098 Read codes and 1,800 SNOMED codes. Two authors (DL and PP)
screened the codes for relevance, with conflicts resolved through discussion.

Where codes were likely to indicate illicit opioid use, but did not specifically mention opioids, we classified them as ‘probable’. Some clinical codes described prescriptions, tests or adverse reactions relating to methadone and buprenorphine.
